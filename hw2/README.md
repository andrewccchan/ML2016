How to use the program  
Training : ./train.sh training_file_name model  
Test : ./test.sh model test_file_name prediction_name  

NOTE: training_file_name and prediction_name should be put under the same folder as the source code.  
If the filename does not end with .csv, the program will add it automatically.
